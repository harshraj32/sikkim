# Offline First Web Application

## Motivation
Many schools in sikkim face network issues due its geography(i.e, hilly areas) making it impossible for other branches of the same school to have a single collective database for students.
So This project helps schools to store the student details offline first on their computers in their web browsers(i.e, inbrowser database),
and then checks for the network,when its avaiable at a decent speed based on the size of data, it sends the data to the cloub server(in this case IBM server)
all other schools having access to the cloub database can view the updated results.

This project provides a nice dasboard for viewing the student details and provides neccessary tools for the teachers to filter out students or maintain an attendance record or timetable of their classes.
